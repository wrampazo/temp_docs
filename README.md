**Introduction**
*"Bazaar"* was created as a final project for Harvard CS50 course and to support a non-profitable organization from Brazil, called "Amigos do Bem", ([https://www.amigosdobem.org/en/main/](https://www.amigosdobem.org/en/main/)). It is a simple web application developed to control stock/inventory and sell products such as Books, CDs, DVDs, Statues, Crafts, etc. to support their activities during fairs or other events (such as a bazaar!). It would be like a point of sale, providing basically features. In fact, it was created to replace a excel sheet. Which is what folks have been using at Amigos do Bem. We all know how powerful and amazing Excel is. However, it is not the best tool to handle orders in a point of sale, and it is really easy to have many failures and mistakes. The sheet used has only a list of products and prices, with another sheet to register orders - everything is manual. Bazaar app has also an easy way to query and report sales, product stock, and balance.
